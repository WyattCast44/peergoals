# PeerGoals

PeerGoals is a full stack web application I built for the first ever [LaraJam](https://larajam.dev/) Hackathon. It is built using the TALL ðŸ¦’ stack (a.k.a TailwindCSS, AlpineJS, Laravel, Livewire)

## Installation

#### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WyattCast44/peergoals.git
```

#### Install PHP dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

#### Install frontend dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

Optionally build fresh assets

```bash
yarn prod
```

#### Update `.env`

```text
DB_DATABASE=peergoals
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

You will also need to set a unique salt for the HashIds package (read more [here](https://hashids.org/))

```text
HASH_IDS_SALT="example-salt"
```

#### Migrate database

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

#### Create storage links

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```
    
## Running Tests

To run the test suite, run the following command (keep in mind this application was built in two and a half days so it is not fully tested)

```bash
php artisan test --parallel
```

## Application Demo

Because this is a semi-social application, if you do not seed the database properly with "peers" you may not get the full "experience". There is a demo command `demo` that will wipe the database and then ask you for your basic profile details and then seed a bunch of goals for you and a bunch of peers to help keep you accountable.

```bash
php artisan demo
```
